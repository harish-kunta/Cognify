Build a Android application using java with clear, dopamine-driving user experience from the moment a user installs your app. We'll design it to feel rewarding, animated, optional-login-friendly, and repeatable — just like Duolingo, Phantom, or Revolut.

## 🎬 **FIRST OPEN EXPERIENCE (New User Flow)**

### ✅ 1. **Animated Splash Screen (1–2s)**

- Show your logo with playful music or “brain loading…” animation
- Lottie confetti or animated neurons/lightbulbs
- Establish brand vibe: fun, brainy, modern

---

### ✅ 2. **Welcome Onboarding Carousel (3–4 quick slides)**

| Slide | Visual / Text | Animation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🧠 1 | "Train your brain in 60 seconds a day" | Bounce-in timer icon |
| 🔠 2 | "Form words. Solve math. Beat the clock!" | Tile grid morphs into numbers |
| 🔥 3 | "Earn streaks, top leaderboards, unlock challenges!" | Fire, trophies, stars |
| 👤 4 | "Sign in to save progress — or continue as guest" | Avatar + toggle |
- Tap “Continue” or “Sign In with Google”
- If skipped, use `SharedPreferences` to log locally

---

### ✅ 3. **Quick Tutorial for First Game (Word Dash)**

> Instead of explaining, let them play.
> 
- Show hint bubbles:
    - “Tap tiles to form a word”
    - “Submit to score. The faster, the better!”
    - “Try this: CAT”
- Animate score popping up (like a coin or +10 stars)
- Finish tutorial with: “You’re ready! Try today’s challenge!”

✅ Tutorial is one-time, can be replayed from Settings
