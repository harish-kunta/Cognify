## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Place your **google-services.json** inside the `app/` directory.
3. Build and install from Android Studio **or** run:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

## Building from Source
The project uses Gradle with the Android Gradle Plugin. Android Studio Electric Eel or newer is recommended. `local.properties` must point to your Android SDK location.

## Gameplay
### Word Dash
Form as many valid words as you can from a 4√ó4 grid before time runs out. Longer and trickier words earn exponentially more points.

### Quick Math
Answer as many arithmetic questions as possible in 60 seconds. Questions scale in difficulty and faster responses are rewarded with higher scores.

## XP, Streaks & Leaderboards
Each completed game grants XP based on your performance. Keeping a daily streak adds extra XP and lets you climb the global leaderboard. XP thresholds unlock badges from **Rookie** all the way up to **Legend**.

## Score Calculation
For a deep dive into how every point is awarded see [SCORING.md](SCORING.md).
